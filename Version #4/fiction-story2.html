      <p class="why-is-this-linked"><br>My breath comes in short bursts, as I trudge up the small, cracked, concrete steps towards the crystalline podium. My head continues a normal dance of anxiety, shifting between panic, and focusing attention on the muscular rhythm of the lungs. This speech, I’ve been preparing for the past month - is for another planet-wide address. It mostly concerns boring production updates; they do not compete well with the entertainment news of planet &#x27;Dirt&#x27; and the goings-on of the life forms there. And I am sure the Ketamine IV dreamers will not be unhooking their intravenous tubes to tune in. <br>‍<br>With each step, my Father’s words, bounce back and forth in my head, &#x27;reality is never as it seems.&#x27; Not exactly advice that a 10-year-old brain was able to conceptualize, or make use of. But my father was a product of a different time, during his childhood, the wars were still raging in the lower orbits surrounding our planet. Bloody fighting with the Klambindites who had been holding our planet hostage with an embargo for years. What sparked the conflict, is up for debate, it seems history maintains a translucence to it. The lessons learned during that terrible conflict were drilled into me during my schooling years. They concerned the general lack of interest in the &#x27;sanctity&#x27; of life. Which inevitably led to the genocide. The Klambindites and our people were different races and during those times neither group had transcended their differences, and our species, in particular, was still trapped in noticing the oddness of the other - using it as fuel for war. During times of armed conflict, you blink and one year has turned into ten. A general numbness descends over the people in regards to the amount of dead, wounded, and missing in action. The large numbers of casualties that once shocked and appalled citizens quickly become commonplace. Sitting in the classroom, as a promising student, I never dreamed of the title of King. As a child I shied away from the spotlight, not wanting to attract any more attention than was absolutely necessary. When walking towards the pellucid podium, I feel that same rubbery feeling flowing down my legs, no different than being called upon by the teacher.<br><br>My family comes from the house Garnuki, an old family line, from the region of the Tubular Nebula. According to family legends, it was someone from our family tree that came up with the first design of the great equalizer and the cloaking screen. Not a proud family story to know that your own lineage was responsible for death on a scale you can hardly wrap your head around. But also redeemed by a technology that saved countless lives. The pursuit of technological advancement always seems to be a double-edged sword. You may have only heard of the code name for the cloaking screen &#x27;hidden in plain sight&#x27;. Without getting too technical, two large, proto-ion-combinators project out a &#x27;smokescreen&#x27; around the planet. Making it unseeable to outside eyes, lasers, probes, and it even bends light itself. Once the smokescreen was activated a Klambindite forged message was transmitted on all subspace-frequencies &#x27;The planet Arakbar has been destroyed.&#x27; Technology and deception have allowed our planet to remove ourselves from the wars and disagreements that are always rampant throughout the galaxy and go unnoticed for the past two centuries. <br><br>With no conflicts going on - a collective shift towards creation and not destruction began to take hold. Today little physical labor is needed - but with the same stroke, no innovation is being produced. A stagnation brought about by thousands of centuries of progress. And I fear we are drifting towards a society without purpose. Almost all processes have been mechanized and robotized. We have no day laborers, no-one cleans houses, no workforce has to engage in the many dangerous jobs that used to plague us. The ability to disengage from interstellar warfare, lack of dangerous occupations, has resulted in a tripling of life expectancy for our citizens in the past hundred years. Class XTR Robots handle the planting, tilling, and harvesting of our food production. While automation has rendered no need for our people’s involvement in any stage of the manufacturing process.<br>‍<br>We hide under our cloaking device, choosing to remove ourselves from the cosmic giggle. One thing that our hard-working scientists of robotics, innovation, and technology never predicted was how our civilization would spend its time in this new leisure-focused way of life. There has developed almost an even split in our civilization. One half has decided to spend the majority of its time watching the British bake off, bachelorette, and other various entertainments of planet Dirt. The other half prefers to enter “the long sleep”. Under the drip of the Ketamine IV, they drift into a lucid dream that can last years at a time. Some think of it as an extended holiday while others speak of an exploration of their own consciousness. Whatever your take on the activity it’s captivating enough to snare half of the populace into the endless night. I often wonder how historians will write about this time period in the context of our planet’s long history. Are we going to be thought of as fools? Clearing my throat as I reach the podium, “Thank you for your attention.” <br></p>
