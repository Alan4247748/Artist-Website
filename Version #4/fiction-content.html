      <p class="paragraph-12"><br>These rubber boots never seem to fit right, struggling to get them to snap into place over my heel. Every day I tug on the top straps, straining and pulling with stiff fingers against brutal leather. My mate Selber says: “Was geht diggha? If ya wanna get dem Gummistiefel on, make em warm, put dem unter the fire.” Pulling out a cigarette clink, ding, zing, and ping as he walks off, cackling with laughter. The struggle continues—damn boots. The business of working on a crabbin’ boat was more of a family expectation than a personal dream. The stories about crabbing - I heard were romanticized - similar to old wars where only the hero’s names are remembered. What reached my ears were tales of good pay, comradery, and other hupti-ha. People never spoke about pissing your pants from fear, or what life trapped on a 12-cabin-boat, surrounded by a cultural hodgepodge of drifters from remote corners of the globe would entail. Or the flattening icy gusts of wind that rips through layers of clothing like a hen pecking at the grass. All while maintaining a numbing schedule of working 35 days straight in 12-hour shifts of on-duty and rest. This sort of atmosphere can cause you to titter on edge. Mixed with being this close to the North Pole, it doesn’t really matter if you are working during the day or night shift. It’s always dark. Clank, clank, clank...some of the crab pots hitting the port-side of the boat. These pots are about the size of two fat cows stacked next to each other. The metal cages of death are baited with chicken liver - and working in pairs - we drop these pots, one after the other, hoping to bring in a fresh score of King Crab. A short season means that ole Captain Dostoyevsky isn’t the biggest believer in taking breaks. But who can blame him, Captain’s responsibility to push the crew, and catch all the crab we can. It’s the only way to get paid, and if he doesn’t do the job, then who the hell will. Being my 1st season on a crab fishing boat, half the crew hasn’t even bothered learning my name—I am called Greenie. The first shift I was so fucking nervous, I puked down the front of my rain slicker. And every day after continuing a vomiting streak, only learning to do it over the side of the boat. I’m a deckhand, which is the most dangerous job, guess that’s why it pays so well. My motion sickness goes mad, with the rocking and bobbing of the boat as it crawls up and down the 3-meter waves. The first few days were spent white-knuckling the railing as large waves broke over the front bow, almost knocking me into the ocean—kind of wish it had. <br>‍<br>I miss the days sitting by the harbor, making jokes, and sippin bottles of stolen beer with my mates. Then staggering back home, laying in bed, dreaming silly dreams, enveloped in the peacefulness of being in a room alone. Only to be awoken by my father - also staggering home - he was a playful kind of fellow. “Yah, sonny yer jzt gotta work a couple eh seasons, save up sum dough, then get a proper education, work in an office for the rest of yur life”. I wish the old drunk hadn’t drowned. Today, I climbed into the crow’s nest or as Selber calls it “birds-augen.” The ocean looks the same from way-up-there, but it acts as a small reprieve from the regular-boat-life cycle. One topic on the tip of the tongue amongst professional crabbers concerns the declining numbers of crab hauled in each season. The theories abound on what might be the cause. Captain Dostoyevsky says, “yea well, some of these tree-huggers say its climate change, or overfishing, a bunch of svo-lachs!” Spitting a long wad of black juice into a paper cup and adjusting his chewing tobacco. “Environmentalists never try to understand how difficult the crabbing seasons are - ever seen one of em’ on a boat - think they spend much time out at sea? Nah, they just look at numbers and make guesses. I spent 20 seasons out here, things are always up and down. Now I will admit there we’ve got plenty of problems - overfishing, pollution, environmental degradation et cetera; however, the solutions are none too simple.” <br><br>The ocean has a vastness to it, that even when growing up on the coast, its immensity is never quite fully grasped, not until you spend a month at sea without glimpsing anything but more and more crystal-blue-water. Broken up only by the occasional passing crabber or cruise ship - it all starts to fuck with your head, maybe that’s why pirates did such fouled up shit. Perhaps half of them went mad, spending months on transcontinental voyages across the Atlantic and Pacific. The only way to calm their ocean induced-inner-madness was by plundering and butchering those unlucky enough to find themselves on the receiving end of those hostile sails. Blargh, blurgh, splat last night’s lobster risotto exits both my mouth and nose. Burning the nostril channels, and leaving behind a tangy-sweet taste - of yesterday&#x27;s - lemony, spicy, white sauce. Whipping it away with a hanky - food is delicious - the first time you taste it. The creaking sound of pipes reaches my ears as water crosses from the boiler room. This shower has two frequencies scalding hot and freezes your nipples cold—zero in between. Once a day, I attempt to increase the blood flow into my half-frozen fingers. Another long day of slipping and falling smashing my butt dozens of times. All the while, Selber was crackin’ up with laughter. “Eh Greenie, du bist eine blöd cow or what?” Entering the mess hall, crossing the thick wall of opium mixed with tobacco smoke that separates the room. If you did not chase the dragon when arriving on the ‘Single Lady’, then you most certainly have the habit by the time you dock into the harbor at season&#x27;s end. Curry, God-Damn, curry, staring down into the plate of yellowish mush. I’ve been shitting liquid for two days now. No sooner as the cigarette touches my lips - NEE-eu, NEE-eu, NEE-eu - the alarm ejecting its warning tone. The 1st mate bursts through the door “ON YOUR FEET! SHIPS GOING DOWN”. Bone-chilling panic spreads through my body as we flow from the mess hall out onto the deck like an organized school of fish. My eyes tearing around, searching for smoke, fire, and lifeboats. But I find none - my ears catch the sound of a familiar laugh. Selber standing in his yellow rain slicker with deck lights bouncing off of him. Tears of bliss streaming down his face “Komm schon Greenie, that’s the oldest trick im die book”. <br></p>
