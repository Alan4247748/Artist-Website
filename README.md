# Artist-Website

So this is attempt to combine the NES.CSS Framework with my aims of creating a website to house some of fiction writing // visual art


All graphics are made by myself. 

The aim of uploading this is to also start to improve // edit aspects of the website moving forward. And to use push these updates directly into Netlify

Also, I will soon be adding a JP5 (Java Processing) interface I am designing to the website. 

I'm a young, dumb, lost programmer. So if any of these is confusing, clunky, etc. its because I am self-teaching all of this.
